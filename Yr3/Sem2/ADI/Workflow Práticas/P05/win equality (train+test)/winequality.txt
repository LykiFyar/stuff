1. Title: Wine Quality 

   These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks.
   The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are munch more normal wines than
   excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent
   or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So
   it could be interesting to test feature selection methods. 

2. Number of Instances: red wine - 1599; white wine - 4898. 

3. Number of Attributes: 11 + 2 output attribute

   5 - chlorides
   6 - free sulfur dioxide
   7 - total sulfur dioxide
   8 - density
